# This is a stress model.
# Tension is taken as positive (physics convention).
# This model provides both meaningful orientation and meaningful magnitude.
# It is defined for depths from 1 km to 100 km.
# These model values vary with depth.
#
# Data Columns:
# 1) Longitude in degrees, WGS84 (California has negative LON)

# 3) Depth in km relative to mean sea level (positive: below sea-level; negative: above sea-level)
# 4) See stress tensor component in MPa
