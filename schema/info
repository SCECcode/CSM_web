"which ones are absolutely essential", the answer is fields 1-9.
"is never a NaN", the answer is that fields 10-20 can be NaNs, the rest are all filled every time.

Blurb Text for each model:
"H2020_Ridgecrest" model contributed by J. Hardebeck. This is a stress orientation model based on earthquake focal mechanism inversion (orientation only). Model values do not vary with depth.
"HM04_NorCal_ClusterBased" model contributed by J. Hardebeck and A. Michael. This is a stress orientation model based on earthquake focal mechanism inversion (orientation only). Model values do not vary with depth.
"HM04_NorCal_FaultBased" model contributed by J. Hardebeck and A. Michael. This is a stress orientation model based on earthquake focal mechanism inversion (orientation only). Model values do not vary with depth.
"PEZW02_LongValley" model contributed by S. Prejean, W. Ellsworth, M. Zoback, and F. Waldhauser. This is a stress orientation model based on earthquake focal mechanism inversion (orientation only). Model values do not vary with depth.  Model gives principal stress axis orientation only.  Visualized SHmax values are approximate (±15º) and Aphi values represent faulting regime only

"PEZW02_LongValley_for_plotting_only". THIS IS THE FILE WITH SHmax and Aphi for plotting…, THE OTHER IS THE ONE THEY’D DOWNLOAD.  ONLY NEED ONE ENTRY FOR LONG VALLEY.

"PH01_Creeping_Table1" model contributed by A. Provost and H. Houston. This is a stress orientation model based on earthquake focal mechanism inversion (orientation only). Model values do not vary with depth.
"PH01_Creeping_Table2" model contributed by A. Provost and H. Houston. This is a stress orientation model based on earthquake focal mechanism inversion (orientation only). Model values do not vary with depth.
"PH03_NorCal" model contributed by A. Provost and H. Houston. This is a stress orientation model based on earthquake focal mechanism inversion (orientation only). Model values do not vary with depth.

"SHS23_MtLewis" model contributed by R. Skoumal, J. Hardebeck, and D. Shelly. This is a stress orientation model based on earthquake focal mechanism inversion (orientation only). Model values do not vary with depth.
"Johnson-Hearn" model contributed by K. Johnson and E. Hearn.  This is a stressing-rate model based on geodetically inferred strain rates. Model values do not vary with depth.
"Kreemer-Hearn" model contributed by C. Kreemer, Z. Young, and E. Hearn. This is a stressing-rate model based on combined geologically and geodetically inferred strain rates. Model values do not vary with depth.
